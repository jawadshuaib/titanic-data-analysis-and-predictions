# Titanic Data Analysis

In this notebook, we're going to analyze the Titanic dataset and build machine learning models to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like passenger class, sex, and age.

After splitting the data, we will train it through Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and the Random Forest Classifier. The results will then be compared on the test data to find the most accurate classifier for this dataset.

Logistic Regression provided the most accurate results. We then save this data as a pickle file to quickly consume it on a web base application if needed (Amazon/Azure/Google all provide great platforms for this).
